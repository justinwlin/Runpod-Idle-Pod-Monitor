## ‚ö° Quick Start

### üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running on RunPod (Recommended)
Just click the Runpod image template, and start it on the lowest CPU pod.

**That's it!** üéâ The `RUNPOD_API_KEY` environment variable is pre-configured.

### üíª Running Locally

#### 1. Clone & Setup
```bash
git clone <repository>
cd RunpodMonitor
echo "RUNPOD_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env
```

#### 2. Start Server
```bash
python server.py
```

#### 3. Open Browser
```
http://localhost:8080
```

## Exclude Pods
On the home page, you'll see if something is excluded or not. Click the "Monitor" button or the "Exclude" button to switch it to actually shut off or to exclude it from monitoring.

## üê≥ Docker (Secure & Easy)

```bash
# Build
docker build -t runpod-monitor .

# Run with API key from environment
docker run -d \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -e RUNPOD_API_KEY=your_api_key_here \
  -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data \
  runpod-monitor
```
## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The server starts with sensible defaults. To customize:

### Options:
2. **Use the web interface** - Go to Config page for real-time changes. The changes get persisted to the file on the server, so you can turn the server on and off, as long the file is not destroyed.
3. **Environment variables** - `RUNPOD_API_KEY` is auto-configured on RunPod when you start a container is already in the env. But you can also set it manually locally by creating a .env file with the key.

### Recommendations:
Just use the Web UI for configurations since it will autopersist into whatever file, and will create a starting configuration file if it doesn't exist based off the yaml template.

### Auto-Stop Settings (via Web UI)
- **CPU/GPU/Memory thresholds** - Set limits (e.g., ‚â§5% usage)
- **Duration** - How long conditions must persist (e.g., 45 minutes)
- **No-change detection** - Stop completely idle pods
- **Exclude pods** - Protect critical workloads
