# üöÄ RunPod Monitor

Monitor and auto-manage your RunPod instances with a simple web interface.

Runpod Image:
https://console.runpod.io/deploy?template=xe00ihiurd&ref=p1oqnqy1

**IF YOU DEPLOY THIS ON RUNPOD** MAKE SURE TO EXCLUDE THE POD YOU ARE RUNNING THIS ON FROM THE MONITORING. There is an "Monitoring" Button on the home page for the pod, which when you click it will switch it to the exclude list.
----

## ‚ö° Quick Start

### üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running on RunPod (Recommended)
Just click the Runpod image template, and start it on the lowest CPU pod.

**That's it!** üéâ The `RUNPOD_API_KEY` environment variable is pre-configured.

### üíª Running Locally

#### 1. Clone & Setup
```bash
git clone <repository>
cd RunpodMonitor
echo "RUNPOD_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env
```

#### 2. Start Server
```bash
python server.py
```

#### 3. Open Browser
```
http://localhost:8080
```

## Exclude Pods
On the home page, you'll see if something is excluded or not. Click the "Monitor" button or the "Exclude" button to switch it to actually shut off or to exclude it from monitoring.

## üê≥ Docker (Secure & Easy)

```bash
# Build
docker build -t runpod-monitor .

# Run with API key from environment
docker run -d \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -e RUNPOD_API_KEY=your_api_key_here \
  -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data \
  runpod-monitor
```
## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The server starts with sensible defaults. To customize:

### Options:
2. **Use the web interface** - Go to Config page for real-time changes. The changes get persisted to the file on the server, so you can turn the server on and off, as long the file is not destroyed.
3. **Environment variables** - `RUNPOD_API_KEY` is auto-configured on RunPod when you start a container is already in the env. But you can also set it manually locally by creating a .env file with the key.

### Recommendations:
Just use the Web UI for configurations since it will autopersist into whatever file, and will create a starting configuration file if it doesn't exist based off the yaml template.

### Auto-Stop Settings (via Web UI)
- **CPU/GPU/Memory thresholds** - Set limits (e.g., ‚â§5% usage)
- **Duration** - How long conditions must persist (e.g., 45 minutes)
- **No-change detection** - Stop completely idle pods
- **Exclude pods** - Protect critical workloads

## üîß Development

### Manual Installation
```bash
pip install uv
uv pip install .
python server.py
```

### CLI Mode (Optional)
```bash
# Interactive mode
python -m runpod_monitor.main

# Monitoring only (no web UI)
python -m runpod_monitor.main --monitor

# List pods
python -m runpod_monitor.main --action list
```

## üåü What You Get

### Auto-Stop Features
- **Stop command timing** - After a pod is identified for stopping, allow 2-3 more data collection cycles (2-3 minutes) for the stop command to take effect before re-triggering
- **Network storage pods** - Pods with network volumes can be stopped using the regular stop functionality (they are paused, not deleted). To permanently delete a network storage pod, you must manually terminate it through the RunPod web interface

## üöÄ Production Tips

1. **API key**: Auto-configured on RunPod, or set locally with `export RUNPOD_API_KEY=your_key`
2. **Configure auto-stop**: Use the web interface Config page
6. **Stop command timing**: When a pod meets auto-stop criteria, the system issues a stop command but continues monitoring. Allow 2-3 data collection cycles (2-3 minutes) for the API stop command to take effect before expecting the pod status to change to EXITED
7. **Network storage pods**: The monitor can safely stop pods with network volumes - they are paused (not terminated/deleted). To permanently delete a network storage pod and its data, manually terminate it via RunPod's web interface

## üìö API Reference

The server exposes a REST API at `http://localhost:8080`:

### Pages
- `GET /` - Dashboard page
- `GET /pods` - Live pod list (HTMX)
- `GET /metrics` - Metrics page with live updates and filterable data
- `GET /config` - Configuration page

### Pod Actions
- `POST /pods/{pod_id}/stop` - Stop a pod with dynamic button update
- `POST /pods/{pod_id}/resume` - Resume a pod with dynamic button update
- `POST /pods/{pod_id}/exclude` - Add pod to exclude list
- `POST /pods/{pod_id}/include` - Remove pod from exclude list

### Configuration
- `POST /config/auto-stop` - Update basic auto-stop settings
- `POST /config/no-change` - Update no-change detection
- `POST /config/sampling` - Update sampling configuration

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/monitoring-status` - Live monitoring status (HTML)
- `GET /api/next-poll` - Next collection time and monitoring status (JSON)
- `GET /api/raw-data?pod_filter={name}` - Filterable raw data table (HTML)
- `GET /status` - System status (JSON)
